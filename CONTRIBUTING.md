# Contributing to some

Thanks for your interest in `some`! 🎉

This project is currently in **early development** and is **not yet open to external contributions**. The architecture, module boundaries, and roadmap are still being actively shaped, and accepting contributions at this stage would create coordination overhead that would slow things down.

## What You Can Do Now

- **Report bugs** — If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ScottsSecondAct/some/issues). Include your OS, terminal emulator, and steps to reproduce.
- **Request features** — Have an idea? Open an issue with the `enhancement` label. No guarantees, but good ideas get noticed.
- **Ask questions** — If something in the docs is unclear, an issue is fine for that too.

## When Will Contributions Be Accepted?

The plan is to open contributions once the project reaches a stable architecture and has clear contribution guidelines in place. When that happens, this document will be updated with:

- Code style and formatting standards
- Testing requirements
- Pull request process
- Areas where help is welcome

Watch the repo or check back for updates.
